# 🧠 Image Classification Using CNN (CIFAR-10 Dataset)

## 📘 Overview

This project explores image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. This notebook demonstrates how CNNs can learn hierarchical patterns in images and effectively classify them.

The key objective is to build and evaluate a simple CNN model that achieves decent classification accuracy without heavy pre-processing or data augmentation.
